Getting started:
    Run an 'npm install' from this dir
    Run ./_configure_editor.bat

Running Cypress tests requires that you have a version of a browser-based app running for Cypress to interact with.

For details on how to run Cypress, see the NPM scripts in ./package.json

The actual tests are located in ./cypress/integration/
